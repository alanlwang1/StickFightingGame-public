			<p>Welcome to the eloquently named Stick Figure Fighting Game! This was technically made by Daniel, Ryan, and Alan. But let's be real, Alan did 90% of the work.
				As our the name suggests, our game consists of stick figures fighting. The game will be split up between Draw Phases and Combat Phases. During Draw Phases, you will 
				be allowed to add vertical/horizontal lines onto the screen, upon which your stick figures will fight on during the Combat Phase. This is currently a 2 player game, 
				you will be given the choice between a Ninja and a Normal Character. Based on the option you choose, you will be either playing a best of three or a best of five. 
				Player that kills the other will be allowed to draw an additional line in an intermediate draw phase.</p>
		<h2> <center> <b> Draw Phase </b> </center> </h2>
